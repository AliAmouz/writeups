# 🛠️ Writeups by Ali Amouz

Welcome to my personal archive of penetration testing writeups, where I document everything I’ve learned from solving **TryHackMe** and **Hack The Box** machines. Each writeup reflects my approach to exploit development, privilege escalation, and real-world vulnerability discovery—often with a North African twist.

## 🔍 What You'll Find

- ✅ Step-by-step walkthroughs of vulnerable machines
- 🧠 Insights into exploit logic, payload crafting, and escalation paths
- 🧪 Debugging notes and troubleshooting pivots
- 📸 Annotated screenshots and terminal output
- 📚 Reflections on methodology, mistakes, and lessons learned

## 🧵 Structure

Writeups are organized by platform
├── tryhackme/ │ 
  ├── machine-name.md │ 
└── ... ├── hackthebox/ │ 
  ├── machine-name.md │ └── ...
  
Each file includes:
- Machine name and difficulty
- Initial foothold strategy
- Escalation techniques
- Root access methodology
- Final thoughts and recruiter-ready takeaways

## 🌍 About Me

I'm Ali Amouz, a junior penetration tester based in Rabat, Morocco—originally from North Carolina, USA. I specialize in:
- Exploit development and binary analysis
- Config injection and post-exec escalation
- Creative prompt engineering and digital representation

Currently climbing the global leaderboards on TryHackMe and Hack The Box, prepping for **eJPT/PJPT certifications**, and seeking an **ethical hacking internship**.

## 📈 Goals

This repo is part of my broader portfolio strategy:
- Showcase technical depth and real-world impact
- Document iterative problem-solving and creative pivots
- Represent Morocco on the global cybersecurity stage
